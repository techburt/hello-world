hello-world
===========

Ok, First use of Github. Hope to be here a lot more.
I'm here in Alaska where it's nice and warm for a November evening. 33 degrees and it will be 37 and rainy this weekend. That's way better than the 10 degrees below we used to have here 40 years ago.

Learning a bunch of stuff right now, will never stop learning as long as there's some life in these old bones.
